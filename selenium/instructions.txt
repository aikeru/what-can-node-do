How to use Selenium with node.js

1. Download the Chrome WebDriver from

https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs

2. Install selenium-webdriver

sudo npm install --save-dev selenium-webdriver

2. Follow instructions on WebDriverJs docs:

https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs

The WebDriverJs matches the WebDriver pretty closely, except that it is adapted for JavaScript.

One way to learn about the API is by looking directly inside the WebDriverJs wrapper code.

This will be under your node_modules folder.

If you execute the sample, it will pop open Chrome with Google.com and close quickly.
